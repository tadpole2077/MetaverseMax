Usage Patterns:
1) MetaverseMaxDbContext : dbContext
* inherits base class dbContext
* Overriding methods:
	1) OnConfiguring()
		Assigning correct db connection string based on reqesting client service (matching metavere world)
		Using optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer()  and assigning explicit query timeout

	2) OnModelCreating()
		Assigning decimal percision for specific table models
		Assigning composite key for specific table models
		Identifiy tables with no primary key  (such as results from some DB SPROC's)

* Defining Common DB Methods
	1) LogEvent()
		Simple Log event to db, with single text blurb



2) DBLogger
* Defining Common DB log menthods used as base by parent database classes
	1) logException()
		Complex log exception to db as Log Entry A, and inner exception extraction as Log Entry B : 2 separate entries.
		Also checks if dbContext is valid/null, and recreates to ensure log event.  (UNTESTED)
		Calls the [_context.LogEvent]  which is MetaverseMaxDbContext.LogEvent()
