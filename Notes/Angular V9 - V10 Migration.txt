https://update.angular.io/?l=2&v=9.1-10.0

Actions:   
	Angular upgrade 9.1.x to 10.0.x,  + Materials + medium complexity
	entryComponents [NgModules] can be removed.  
		Only found in @swimlane/ngx-charts 14.0.0 <<< will need to be upgraded

	Problem Packages:
		@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap  ^6.2.0 (OLD)  : https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
			Installed 8.0.4 (latest with support of Angular 10) 
			App Used By: NdbDropDown Module
			npm i @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap@8.0.4

			Peer dependencies - need to be updated:
				node_modules/jasmine-core 
				node_modules/karma-jasmine-html-reporter OLD: 1.7.0

		
		codelyzer : 5.5.5(OLD) :  NOT Used so removed it.  Code analysis module (not suppored any more it seems)

		Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@angular/localize/init'
			CMD >  ng add @angular/localize
			Package used to add translations for localization support, not using it, but add for possible later use.

		ERROR in ./src/theme.scss
			Module build failed (from ./node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js):
			ModuleBuildError: Module build failed (from ./node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js):
			Error: Node Sass version 5.0.0 is incompatible with ^4.0.0.

			Same issue as in Angular V9, expected, will review but quickly move on to Angular 11.
			"node-sass": "^4.0.0" is a PEER dependency in sass-loader module (needs to be in project root - any version of 4.x)
			sass-loader@10.0.1 is a dependency of core angular module @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1002.4
			Using webpack@4.44.1 which is good
			Actually installed:  node-sass@5.0.0.   Attempting to install 4.x previously caused GPY compile issues (complex)
