REST Service JSON:
====================
Concern:
*  JSON hijacking :
	A JSON Object is not a valid Javascript file
	A JSON Array is a valid javascrpt file
	Meaning a JSON Array can be "executed" on the client browser.
	Potentially a JSON Aarry repsonse that is hijacked, could contain malicious code.
	[2016 onward] Modern browsers typically fix bugs that protect against this type of attack.

* JSONP 
	ISSUE: cross domain requests using script Bypass of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Protocol
	Background: JSONP allowed request from another server of a JSON package to use that data as a parameter in a native function call ( processThis(jsonResponse) )
		<script src="https://foo.com/my.json?myCallback=processThis"></script>
		Its a bypass of secuirty, bad practice,  use CORS model with Get request.
		No failure code model with this method.


* JSON Reponse Format
	Convert to using Standard Jsend: https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend
