			'node-sass' usage is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version. To opt-out of the deprecated behaviour and start using 'sass' uninstall 'node-sass'.
		Solution: npm uninstall node-sass

	On npm start >> Option "extractCss" is deprecated: Deprecated since version 11.0. No longer required to disable CSS extraction for HMR.
		Solution: Remove option ["extractCss": true] from angular.json

Potential Code change:
	routerLinkActiveOptions property of RouterLinkActive now has a more specific type. You may need to update code accessing this property to align with the changes.
		This is used in nav-menu.component, may need to update once i can run the project.
