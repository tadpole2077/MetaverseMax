> In Angular version 15, the deprecated `relativeLinkResolution` config parameter of the Router is removed.
  This migration removes all `relativeLinkResolution` fields from the Router config objects.
  Migration completed (No changes made).

> Since Angular v15, the `RouterLink` contains the logic of the `RouterLinkWithHref` directive.
  This migration replaces all `RouterLinkWithHref` references with `RouterLink`.
