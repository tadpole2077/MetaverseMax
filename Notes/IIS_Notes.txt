IIS Core Configuration:
============================
2023/01/12 :  Using AppNetCore Module V2
			  App Pool:
				.NET CLR Version: v4.0.30319
				Managed pipleline: Integrated
				Start application pool immediately (enabled)
				Idle Time-out: 0   (Default: 200 ,  0 = no idle timeout)
				Idle Time-out action: Terminate

			  Recycling > Regular Time interval >  0 ( = no regular interval of recycle time :  20 (default in minutes))
			  Recycling > Specific Time : 24:00:00

NOTES:
* Idle timeout :  If no request is received within x minutes - IIS kills the worker process and frees up RAM
				  Useful in a server with many small sites with low load, and server resources are limited
				  High availability website might consider using 0 for this setting

* Recycing > Regular Time interval
				  https://sitecore.stackexchange.com/questions/26880/any-reason-not-to-set-iis-regular-time-interval-minutes-to-0-on-a-sitecore-ser
				  No issue with disabling recycling, its use is if/when an application has memeory leaks
				  or some anomoly that slowly builds.  If after monitoring your app for a period - no memory issues, then 
				  acceptly to disable this.
				  Alternatively set Recycling to a specific time each time each day.

TEST

Error
===========================
1) Data sync - job failure
Event Log:  Event 1005, IIS AspNetCore ModuleV2
			Failed to gracefully shutdown application 'MACHINE/WEBROOT/APPHOST/METAVERSEMAX/API'

Background: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/7367
			Job fails after 6 or 7 hours processing, but can fail at any time
			No exception details logged, its a hard fail/hang.
			Likely due to the prior Recycling setting at 29hours (1740 mins) - default
